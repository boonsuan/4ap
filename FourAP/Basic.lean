# The language of the paper

This file fixes the conventions used to formalize the paper
“A 4AP-free permutation of the positive integers”.  The construction takes place
in `ℕ`, which in Lean includes zero.  The final theorem shifts the values by one.

An arithmetic progression is expressed using the two equations
`a + c = 2 * b` and `b + d = 2 * c`.  For natural-number entries these equations,
together with `a ≠ b`, are equivalent to having a nonzero **integer** common
difference.  Thus decreasing progressions are included throughout.

to the paper's progression `a, a+r, a+2r, a+3r`, with a nonzero **integer**
common difference. In particular, decreasing progressions are included. -/

/-- The completion `𝒞(P)` from the paragraph preceding Lemma 1, with an arbitrary
background relation `R`.  `List.idxOf` is the length of the list for a missing
entry, so the first disjunct orders the prefix and puts it before the tail. -/
